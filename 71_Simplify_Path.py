# You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

# The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

# A single period '.' represents the current directory.
# A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
# Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
# Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.
# The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

# The path must start with a single slash '/'.
# Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
# The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
# The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
# Return the simplified canonical path.


# Example 1:

# Input: path = "/home/"

# Output: "/home"

# Explanation:

# The trailing slash should be removed.

# Example 2:

# Input: path = "/home//foo/"

# Output: "/home/foo"

# Explanation:

# Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

# Example 3:

# Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

# Output: "/home/user/Pictures"

# Explanation:

# A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

# Example 4:

# Input: path = "/../"

# Output: "/"

# Explanation:

# Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

# Example 5:

# Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

# Output: "/.../b/d"

# Explanation:

# "..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.


# Constraints:

# 1 <= path.length <= 3000
# path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
# path is a valid absolute Unix path.
